#### Loading AudGenDB Template ####

1. **Place the 'audgendb_template' folder into your 'Documents' folder** on Mac OS X (don't place it into a subfolder or the script won't work).  
2. Open the R Markdown file, 'LoadAudGenDB_Rmarkdown_Template.Rmd', in RStudio. 
3. Knit the document using the icon at the top of this panel with yarn and knitting needle followed by "Knit". 
4. Look at the output below, and it should be a directory listing that includes the 'audgendb_template' folder. 
5. Contact Bryan, if this doesn't work. 

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
