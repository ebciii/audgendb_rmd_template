#### Description: ####

**Contents:** This folder contains 2 files in addition to this README.md file:

- The 'Rmarkdown document Template HowTo.txt' file
- The 'audgendb_template' folder.

The txt file will give links to support pages in R Markdown explaining how to make and use templates.  The folder is ready to place in the template folder for your computer system.   

**Implementation:** The folder 'audgendb_template' should be copied to the Template directory for R on your computer.

The files/subfolder structure must be maintained for the template to work.

The 'template.yml' is written in the YAML markdown language, and provides metadata for the template.

The 'skeleton.Rmd' file contains the R Markdown for the template. It must reside in the skeleton subfolder to work properly
